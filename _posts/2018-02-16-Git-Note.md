## 修正不同作業系統的斷行

[GitHub suggests](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/) that you should make sure to only use \n as a newline character in git-handled repos.

There's an option to auto-convert:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

Of course, this is said to convert crlf to lf, while you want to convert cr to lf. I hope this still works …

And then convert your files:

```bash
# Remove everything from the index
$ git rm --cached -r .

# Re-add all the deleted files to the index
# You should get lots of messages like: "warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in <file>."
$ git diff --cached --name-only -z | xargs -0 git add

# Commit
$ git commit -m "Fix CRLF"
```
